## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo on GitHub.
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo root.
3. In repo **Settings → Pages**, set Source = Deploy from a branch, Branch = `main`, Folder = `/`.
4. Open `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

**Notes**
- Listing images are *stock* placeholders. Replace with photos you have rights to use or your IDX feed.
- MLS/IDX search is a placeholder iframe — paste your vendor embed code in `search.html`.
- Market stats on community pages are clearly marked **sample** values.
